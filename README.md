The main file is a SageMath (version 9.2) notebook "Graded_characters_in_O_0.ipynb", which contains lots of functions for dealing with combinatorial calculations inside the BGG category O. For example, it contains graded characters of all structural modules (Verma, projective and tilting modules), Kazhdan-Lusztig orders, and Lustig's a-function.

The folder "Graded_characters_in_O_0_data" contains lots of pre-calculated data, most of which the notebook loads automatically. So, the folder should not be tampered with manually. Most of the calculations were performed on Uppsala University's cloud computing server.

The code was written to help find examples, counterexamples and conjectures, in a joint work with Hankyung Ko and Volodymyr Mazorchuk.
